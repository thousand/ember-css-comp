Contains three basic ember apps in `packages`.

* `css-blocks-app` includes sass and eyeglass preprocessing
* `css-modules-app` includes sass preprocessing
* `plain-scss-app` uses `ember-cli-sass` and BEM style classes.


## Usage

* `yarn install` at the root
* `yarn generate` at the root to create a bunch of components and corresponding styles. (edit the `COUNT` constant in `gen-content.js` if needed)
* Do what you gotta do
